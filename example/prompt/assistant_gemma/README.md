# Gemma Assistant

This example should be run with Gemma-style models that are tuned to behave like an instruction-following assistant chatbot.
Most importantly, the model must have special `<start_of_turn>` and `<end_of_turn>` tokens.

It's like the [assistant_chatml](../assistant_chatml/) example but without a system prompt.
